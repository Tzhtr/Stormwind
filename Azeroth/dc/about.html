                    The original developers of World of Warcraft, also known as WoW, were a group of talented designers,
                    programmers, and artists who worked at Blizzard Entertainment. The team was led by Rob Pardo and
                    Jeff
                    Kaplan, who were responsible for overseeing the game's overall design and development. Other notable
                    members of the team included Tom Chilton, who served as the game's lead designer, and Chris Metzen,
                    who
                    helped to create the game's rich lore and storylines. Together, this group of developers created a
                    massively multiplayer online game that captivated millions of players around the world and set the
                    standard for the modern MMORPG genre. Their innovative ideas and dedication to the game's quality
                    helped
                    to make WoW one of the most successful and influential video games of all time.
