                <h2>Second War</h2>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    The Second War in the Warcraft universe was a dark time for the people of Stormwind. The Orcish
                    Horde, led by the brutal warlock Gul'dan, launched a devastating assault on the city, causing
                    widespread destruction and loss of life. The city's defenders fought bravely, but ultimately they
                    were overwhelmed, and the Horde sacked the city, leaving it in ruins. In the aftermath of the war,
                    the survivors of Stormwind faced a daunting task. They had to rebuild their shattered homes and
                    livelihoods, while also dealing with the trauma of the war and the loss of loved ones. But despite
                    the enormity of the task before them, the people of Stormwind were determined to persevere. With the
                    leadership of King Varian Wrynn, they began the long process of reconstruction.
                    <br><br>
                    Over the years that followed, Stormwind gradually rose from the ashes of its destruction. The city
                    was expanded and fortified, with new walls and defenses built to protect it from future threats. The
                    people of Stormwind worked tirelessly to rebuild their homes, businesses, and infrastructure, and
                    they did so with a renewed sense of purpose and pride in their city. Although the scars of the
                    Second War would never truly fade, the people of Stormwind emerged from the conflict stronger and
                    more united than ever before. Today, Stormwind stands as a testament to the resilience and
                    determination of its people, a shining example of what can be accomplished in the face of even the
                    greatest adversity.

                <h2>Start of World of Warcraft</h2>
                <br><br>
                <p>Following the events of Warcraft III, the kingdom of Stormwind faced numerous challenges in the World
                    of
                    Warcraft universe. The city was not safe from danger, as agents of the Horde and the Black
                    Dragonflight
                    launched attacks on the city, causing destruction and loss of life. Despite these threats, Stormwind
                    remained resilient and continued to grow under the leadership of King Varian Wrynn, with new
                    buildings
                    and infrastructure added to support the growing population.
                    <br><br>
                    During this time, Stormwind also faced internal strife, as King Varian went missing under mysterious
                    circumstances. His young son, Prince Anduin Wrynn, took the throne in his absence and had to deal
                    with
                    the opposition of a faction of nobles who sought to take advantage of the kingdom's weakened state.
                    Despite the challenges, Prince Anduin proved himself a capable leader and eventually reunited the
                    kingdom, restoring order.
                    <br><br>
                    As the Alliance faced numerous threats from other factions, Stormwind sent its finest heroes to
                    various
                    parts of Azeroth to confront these dangers head-on. The city played a major role in the Alliance's
                    efforts to combat the Burning Legion, the Scourge, and other threats to the world. Stormwind's brave
                    warriors and mages participated in battles across the continent of Azeroth, defending the kingdom
                    against any threat.
                    <br><br>
                    Despite the challenges and losses suffered by the Alliance in their struggles, Stormwind emerged
                    from
                    the conflicts stronger and more united than ever before. The city remained a beacon of hope and
                    progress
                    in the face of adversity, with a renewed sense of purpose and determination to defend their kingdom
                    against any threat.
