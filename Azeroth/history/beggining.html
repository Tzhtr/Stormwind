                <h2>Creators of Stormwind</h2>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    The Kingdom of Stormwind is a powerful and self-sufficient nation that has a long and prosperous
                    history. Its founding can be traced back to 1,200 years before the First War when the descendants of
                    the Arathi bloodline migrated south from the nation of Arathor, traveling past the rocky mountains
                    of Khaz Modan until they settled in the northern region of the continent they would name Eastern
                    Kingdoms. In
                    a fertile valley, they founded the kingdom of Stormwind.
                    <br><br>
                    The kingdom quickly became a self-sufficient power in its own right, with the king served loyally by
                    the knights of the Brotherhood of the Horse and the clerics of the Holy Order of Northshire Clerics.
                    Secretive conjurers also served the kingdom, and as such, Stormwind Keep had its own court conjurer.
                    The Kirin Tor was also present in the kingdom, as Anduin Lothar was acquainted with their fellow
                    wizards in the realm.

                <h2>Gnoll War</h2>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    The constant bickering and infighting that marred the rules of the former kings of Arathor had no
                    place in the court of Wrynn, and all had been peaceful for many generations in the kingdom until the
                    Gnoll War. King Barathen Wrynn ended the conflict by scattering the unified gnoll packs and bringing
                    back peace, solidifying the rule of the Wrynn dynasty over the entire kingdom.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Following the Gnoll War, the Kingdom of Stormwind began expanding its borders, much to the
                    displeasure of the Gurubashi jungle troll tribes. A series of smaller conflicts between the two
                    factions erupted over time, largely over the territories bordering Stranglethorn Vale that
                    Stormwindian settlers began expanding into. Though initially isolated, the conflict quickly
                    escalated out of control, despite the best efforts of Stormwind's King Barathen Wrynn.

                <h2>Gurubashi War</h2>
                <p>
                    The final provocation came when Prince Llane Wrynn personally led a small party to strike at the
                    Gurubashi leadership in central Stranglethorn, which succeeded in uniting the trolls against
                    Stormwind.
                    Though costly and close-run, the human kingdom eventually emerged victorious, largely due to the
                    intervention of the Guardian Medivh. With the entire troll army completely destroyed or routed at
                    the
                    gates of Stormwind City, the jungle trolls of the south would never succeed in threatening the
                    kingdom
                    again. This bloody conflict was known as the Gurubashi War, and the Stormwindians enjoyed nearly two
                    decades of relative peace after emerging victorious. King Barathen was one of the casualties of the
                    Gurubashi War, and Llane succeeded him as king in the aftermath of the war.
                    <br><br>
                    These challenges would soon be put to the test, as the kingdom would soon find itself embroiled in
                    the First War, a devastating conflict that would threaten the very existence of the human race.
                    Despite the many dangers

                <h2>First War</h2>
                <p>When mysterious creatures were reported around Black Morass, King Llane sent Sir
                    Anduin Lothar to
                    investigate. Lothar led knights to the Morass, but encountered orcs and learned they were preparing
                    for war. Lothar returned to Stormwind, and the city braced itself for battle. The orcs attacked
                    Stormwind and the city's defenders suffered heavy losses. But Lothar and the knights had sailed
                    around the Horde to attack from the rear. They fought fiercely, and with the help of Stormwind
                    soldiers who attacked from the city gates, the orcs were defeated. However, King Llane was later
                    assassinated, and Stormwind was overrun and burned to the ground. The surviving people fled to
                    Lordaeron where they were welcomed, and the Archbishop promised to rebuild Stormwind.</p>
