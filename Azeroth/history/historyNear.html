                <h2>Cataclysm</h2>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    Between the Cataclysm and the Legion expansion, Stormwind City underwent a number of changes and
                    developments. One of the most significant events during this time was the trial and imprisonment of
                    Garrosh Hellscream, former warchief of the Horde.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After the events of the Siege of Orgrimmar, Garrosh was brought to Stormwind to stand trial for his
                    crimes against Azeroth. The trial was held in the newly constructed Pandaria-inspired temple in the
                    city, where Garrosh was eventually found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the wake of Garrosh's trial, the Alliance and Horde entered into a period of tense peace, with
                    each side rebuilding and consolidating their forces. Stormwind City itself also underwent a number
                    of renovations, with many new buildings and structures being added to the city. One of the most
                    notable additions was the Stormwind Harbor, which provided a new gateway to the sea for the city.

                <h2>Legion</h2>
                <br><br>
                <p>Another significant development during this time was the emergence of the Burning Legion, a powerful
                    army of demons bent on the destruction of Azeroth. As the Legion began its invasion of the world,
                    Stormwind City became a key target for their forces. The city was attacked by fel-infused demons and
                    their allies, leading to a number of casualties and significant damage.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite these challenges, the people of Stormwind City remained steadfast in their defense of their
                    home. The city's armies, led by King Varian Wrynn, fought back against the Legion's forces, and
                    eventually emerged victorious. The city remained a key stronghold for the Alliance during the
                    Legion's invasion, serving as a base of operations for many of the game's major quests and
                    storylines.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Overall, the period between the Cataclysm and Legion saw Stormwind City undergo many changes, from
                    the trial of Garrosh Hellscream to the emergence of the Burning Legion. Through it all, the city
                    remained a vital hub of commerce and culture, and a symbol of the Alliance's strength and
                    determination.
